<strong>Task 3.2.3 Practice Exercises – Implementing program logic </strong>

<ol>

 <li>Redefine the transfer method() of the Account class so that it re-uses the deposit() and withdraw() methods to subtract funds from the source account and add funds to the recipient account.</li>

 <li>Suppose we are required to provide an operation that allows us to add interest (given the current interest rate) to all account holders.

  <ol>

   <li>What will the signature of the method look like?</li>

   <li>Give a possible implementation for that method.</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Implement a method to print the details of an Account object to the screen in the following format:</li>

</ol>

ID:       A123

Name: Bob the Builder  Balance: $1243.87

…

(all other details should be displayed)

How would you use this method to display the details for an account object from the main program?

<ol start="4">

 <li>Discuss the design for a class to model a simple Person object in your Programming Squad.</li>

</ol>

You will need to consider the following details in your discussion:

<ol>

 <li>What information is common to all types of people?</li>

 <li>How would you create a new person object in another part of the program?</li>

 <li>What information might we need to retrieve from a Person object?</li>

 <li>What information might we need to change in a Person object?</li>

 <li>Consider how might you might update the Person class you have designed so that there is a connection between a Person and the parents of that Person (which are also Person objects), allowing for the names of a Person’s parents to be displayed with the Person’s details.</li>

</ol>

Discuss how the connection between a given Person and the two Person objects which represent the parents of the Person in question could be set up in the main program.
